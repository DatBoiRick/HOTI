    <h1>The Dot Com Bubble</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>Late 1990's - Age of Ecommerce; Amazon and ebay created a new model of commerce.</li>
  <li>1995 - Jeff Bazos’s Garage was the birthplace of Amazon.com, a company that launched books online.</li>
  <li>Sept 1995- Pier Omidiyare launched ebay from his home office.</li>
  <li>Online commerce became popular due to credit card encryption with use of public key and private key encryption.</li>
  <li>Sept 1998 – ebay was going to go IPO; ebay’s stocks soared and at the end of the first day, the company was worth more than $2 billion</li>
  <li>Henry Blodget, a venture capitalist, predicted Amazon’s stock would double. It doubled in just a few weeks. The Era of madness began and people were going to brokers and buying any stock with dot com</li>
  <li>In the Stock Market, day traders were making the market look like a casino; It became a national sport and obsession</li>
  <li>The 90’s had become the E decade, a new ecommerce venture was brought into the world. There were so many companies with names with dot com. It was known that most of them were doomed from birth and that one would survive.</li>
  <li>Henry Blodget would write emails supporting these companies even though he knew they would not survive. Venture capitalists were supporting these companies because they knew one out of the number of them would survive; The Internet boom turned into a speculative bubble.</li>
  <li>Time Magazine – put Jeff Basos as body of ecommerce;</li>
  <li>The Epicenters of the Internet bubble were silicon Valley and Wall Street</li>
  <li>Chairman of Fed Reserve Bank- Alex Greenspan – He believed that technology was creating a new economy – he decided time had come to cool things down - Feb 2000 & March 2000; feds raised interest rates at highest since 1995. Determined to put Bubble to an end; April 14th 2000- black Friday, NASDAQ fell 355 points; single greatest collapse; 18 months after that – Sept 11 happ</li>
  <li>NY’s Attorney General Elliot Spitzer – tried to reform IPO industry and punish villains (Martha Stewart and Henry Blodget- wall street analyst); US Securities charged Henry Blodget with fraud and he was banned for life; - using critical emails as support – he was charged with Civil Securities fraud.</li>
  <li>Great Dot Com Crash of 2000 and 2001- 3 and a half trillion dollars evaporated in one year.</li>
  <li>A handful of companies survived; Amazon and ebay did something very different- user experience; Amazons policy of letting readers write uncensored book reviews; Amazon was in the business of customer service; focus on their customers.</li>
  <li>The Dot Com Bubble helped built the infrastructure – it happened over 5 years instead of 15.</li>
