    <h1>Internet Search Engines</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>1994 - Jerry Yang and David Filer were trying to find a way to use the internet to win a Stanford University fantasy basketball league. They were looking for sports data and ended up making a directory. They first called it Jerry & David’s Guide to the World Wide Directory and later named it YAHOO. Yahoo was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy</li>
  <li>1995 – Jerry & David needed to find a way to profit.  Yahoo began taking banner ads. Yahoo’s users kept multiplying. Yahoo showed it was possible to make $ on the web. The Web Boom had begun.</li>
  <li>1996 – Excite (Yahoo's Rival) was founded. This was another search engine that used statistical analysis of word relationships in order to provide more efficient searches was started up by Joe Kraus and other Stanford Kids.</li>
  <li>1997 – the internet was exploding. Many were companies turning themselves into portals; Search companies were becoming successful; However, they lost sight of what brought people to them in the first place – to search.</li>
  <li>1998 - Larry Paige & Seregay Brin from Standord came up with Google. When entering a search, Google would produce sites that had the most hits first. Google became popular because it was a site that cared about SEARCH.</li><li></liVinad Khosle, a venture capitalist, suggested Google to merge with Excite. The Google Team showed excite their searches; Excite could have bought Google – but they turned it down; every search company turned them down.>
  <li>1999 - Vinad Khosle, a venture capitalist, suggested Google to merge with Excite. The Google Team showed excite their searches; Excite could have bought Google – but they turned it down; every search company turned them down.</li>
  <li>The Google Venture Capitalists were getting nervous. Google did not have a way to produce funds. They did not want to put ads on their sites. Larry and Seregay came upon a site called Overture; they met Bill Gross from overture and left with no deal;</li>
  <li>2002 - Google released Adword Select, a service similar to Overture which was founded by Bill Gross. Overture sued Google and they resolved it out of court. Adword Select allowed businesses to purchase text ads on search-results pages. Everytime you searched the word CAR in Google,  a link to BMW would come in high. Google would separate ads from organic search results; It was a better user experience. If you type in a search- the keyword will bring up ads related to that word (market research tool).  </li>
  <li>Aug 19, 2004 - Google went public; Google’s IPO was a success; Anyone who bought shares that day made a bundle; Brin & Paige ranked among top 30 richest people in the world. Google’s Moto was Don’t Be Evil; Google put profits in experiments and projects such as Google library, Google books, Google Maps, Google Mail, Picasa, You Tube; etc.</li>
