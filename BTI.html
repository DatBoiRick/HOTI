    <h1>History of The Internet</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>1950's - JCR Licklider, a professor at MA Institute of Technology had a vision that by connecting computers, we would be able to communicate better.</li>
  <li>1957-President Eisenhower created the borough of defense department called: Advanced Research Projects Agency (space & computer science program). Soonafter, Space became NASA and Computer Science was ARPA</li>
  <li>1960's - Americans feared a soviet nuclear attack; America needed an indestructible computer network; Dr Paul Baran was hired to do this through Hot potato routing; Baran decided to chop up the messages into small pieces into each packet (like small postcards) and launch that packet into the network; A packet switching network was designed</li>
  <li>1960-  Leonard Kleinrock, an MIT graduate student was known for work on Queueing Theory about message switching; He determined overall speed of network, access & distributed control, and effective resource sharing with networks. No one switch should control entire network.</li>
  <li>1966 – Larry Roberts was recruited by Bob Taylor of ARPA to build to first network.</li>
  <li>1968- A period of time when there were typewriters, telephones with rotary dials and the lunar module; Larry Robert sought engineers to build ARPA Net (built with interface Message processors); Roberts asked 140 companies including AT&T and IBM to bid on a Packet Switching System; The networking was going to break up the package and deliver it putting it back together; Only one company BBN decided to participate.</li>
  <li>1969 - Packet Switching Communication System was successful. Four sites participated, UCLA being one of them.  By end of 1969, all four sites were interconnected.</li>
  <li>1971 - Raymond Tomlinson invented email.</li>
  <li>1980s: Private networks such as Prodigy, Compuserve & America Online started. </li>
  <li>1983 – TCP-IP Protocol was adopted as the universal standard. </li>
  <li>1985 - Gateway, a node (router) in a computer network, a key stopping point for data on its way to or from other networks, was founded.</li>
  <li>1989 – Physicist Tim Berners Lee founded the World Wide Web. </li>
  <li>1992 – Congress passed a bill taking internet out of hands of government and giving it to the public. Only 50 Web Pages on the internet in 1992. </li>
  <li>1993 – Marc Andreeson, from University of Illinois developed the first user friendly browser called Mosaic and later Netscape. This turned the internet into a graphically rich world. THe web grew by 341,000%.  </li>
  <li>1998- Internet revenue was 301 billion dollars in business & was responsible for 1/3rd of US economic growth.</li>
